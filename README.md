## Dependency Injection Pattern

The Dependency Injection (DI) pattern manages dependencies between components of an application dynamically. It is a design technique that involves providing an object with the dependencies it needs rather than allowing it to instantiate them itself.

### Objective
- Separate object creation from its usage.
- Reduce coupling between application components.
- Facilitate the substitution of dependencies.
- Enable configuration of dependencies at various levels of the application.

### Key Mechanisms
- Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided to an object via its constructor parameters.
- Property Injection: Dependencies are provided to an object via properties or fields.
- Method Injection: Dependencies are provided to an object via dedicated methods.

### Reason for Use
- Simplify dependency management and improve application modularity.
- Facilitate unit testing by allowing injection of mock objects to simulate dependency behavior.
- Promote component reusability by making them independent of their execution environment.

### Result
The Dependency Injection pattern makes an application more flexible, testable, and easily scalable by isolating components and promoting modularity.

### Drawbacks
- Increased complexity in dependency configuration, especially in large-scale applications.
- Risk of configuration overload if all dependencies need to be explicitly specified.
